Personal Projects and Projects from following tutorials

1/5/2019

Finally finished with the bare bones of my first personal android project - StudyRoomScheduler!
StudyRoomScheduler currently relies on a local database created by XAMPP and helps students find empty study rooms faster (in the west campus residence halls of UW).
The project me utilize topics I've learned during the tutorials such as: AsyncTasks, LiveData/ViewModels, RecyclerView, and the process of building/querying from a database.
Possible improvements I may work on in the future:
 - Add log-in credentials (possibly work with UW's login?) to limit room-hoarding.
 - Figure out a way to connect to a remote database that is open to everyone.
 - Implement feature for finding nearest open study room using location.
 - Filtering results from finding nearest spot with by rooms the person can access (residences can only access their own dorm).
 - etc...
